# CLAUDE.md - BMAD Methodology Configuration

## VERSATIL SDLC Framework - Agent Team Configuration

This document defines the **BMAD (Business-Managed Agile Development)** methodology for the VERSATIL SDLC Framework, establishing the roles, responsibilities, and collaboration patterns for our 6 specialized AI agents.

---

## 🔒 CRITICAL: ISOLATION ENFORCEMENT

### **Framework-Project Separation (MANDATORY)**

The VERSATIL framework is **COMPLETELY ISOLATED** from user projects. This is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and MUST be enforced at all times.

#### Isolation Architecture:
```yaml
Framework_Home: "~/.versatil/"           # All framework data here
User_Project: "$(pwd)"                   # User's project (current directory)
Framework_Install: "/usr/local/lib/node_modules/versatil-sdlc-framework/"

Forbidden_In_Project:
  - ".versatil/"          # ❌ OLD method - NEVER use
  - "versatil/"           # ❌ Framework directory
  - "supabase/"           # ❌ Must be in ~/.versatil/supabase/
  - ".versatil-memory/"   # ❌ Must be in ~/.versatil/rag-memory/
  - ".versatil-logs/"     # ❌ Must be in ~/.versatil/logs/

Allowed_In_Project:
  - ".versatil-project.json"  # ✅ ONLY this file (project config)
  - ".gitignore"              # ✅ Should ignore .versatil-project.json
```

#### Why Isolation?
1. **Clean Projects**: No framework pollution in user's codebase
2. **Git Safety**: No accidental commits of framework data
3. **Multi-Project**: Same framework installation works with ALL projects
4. **Updates**: Framework updates don't touch user code
5. **Security**: Framework credentials stay in ~/.versatil/.env

#### Validation:
```bash
# Run this to verify isolation:
npm run validate:isolation

# Auto-runs on:
- npm install (postinstall hook)
- npm start
- Framework initialization
```

#### ⚠️ AGENTS: You MUST:
1. **NEVER** create framework files in user's project
2. **ALWAYS** use `~/.versatil/` for framework data
3. **CHECK** isolation before any file operation
4. **VALIDATE** paths don't cross boundaries
5. **WARN** user if isolation is violated

## 🎯 BMAD Methodology Overview

**BMAD** represents a revolutionary approach to AI-native software development, where specialized agents work in harmony to deliver exceptional software products. Each agent brings unique expertise while maintaining seamless collaboration through intelligent handoffs and context preservation.

### Core Principles:
1. **Isolation First** - Framework and project completely separated
2. **Specialization over Generalization** - Each agent masters specific domains
3. **Context Preservation** - Zero information loss during agent switches
4. **Quality-First Approach** - Maria-QA reviews all deliverables
5. **Business Alignment** - Alex-BA ensures requirements traceability
6. **Continuous Integration** - Real-time collaboration and feedback
