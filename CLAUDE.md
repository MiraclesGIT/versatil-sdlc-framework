# CLAUDE.md - BMAD Methodology Configuration

## VERSATIL SDLC Framework - Agent Team Configuration

This document defines the **BMAD (Business-Managed Agile Development)** methodology for the VERSATIL SDLC Framework, establishing the roles, responsibilities, and collaboration patterns for our 6 specialized AI agents.

---

## 🎯 BMAD Methodology Overview

**BMAD** represents a revolutionary approach to AI-native software development, where specialized agents work in harmony to deliver exceptional software products. Each agent brings unique expertise while maintaining seamless collaboration through intelligent handoffs and context preservation.

### Core Principles:
1. **Specialization over Generalization** - Each agent masters specific domains
2. **Context Preservation** - Zero information loss during agent switches
3. **Quality-First Approach** - Maria-QA reviews all deliverables
4. **Business Alignment** - Alex-BA ensures requirements traceability
5. **Continuous Integration** - Real-time collaboration and feedback
