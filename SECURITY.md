## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Framework Users

#### Maria-QA Security Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
npm run maria:security

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm run marcus:vulnerability-scan

# Validate security headers
npm run marcus:security-headers

# Run OWASP security tests
npm run maria:owasp-scan
```

#### Marcus-Backend Security Configuration
```javascript
// Security middleware configuration
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));

// Input validation
const validateInput = (input) => {
  // Implement proper input validation
  return sanitize(input);
};
```

#### James-Frontend Security Practices
```javascript
// XSS Prevention
const sanitizeHTML = (html) => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(html);
};

// Content Security Policy
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'" />

// Secure cookie handling
document.cookie = "session=value; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict";
```

### For Framework Development

#### Secure Development Lifecycle
1. **Security by Design**: Consider security from project inception
2. **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential security threats
3. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding guidelines
4. **Code Review**: Security-focused peer reviews
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing
6. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring

#### Dependency Management

```

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Security Scans
The framework includes automated security monitoring:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Security Workflow
security-scan:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Security Audit
      run: npm audit --audit-level high

    - name: Dependency Vulnerability Scan
      run: npm run security:scan

    - name: Code Security Analysis
      uses: github/super-linter@v4
      with:
        default_branch: main
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
