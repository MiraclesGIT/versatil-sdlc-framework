### 4. **Learning Demos** (`learning-demos.js`)
**Purpose**: Show continuous improvement and adaptation capabilities.

#### Demonstrations:
- **Week-long Simulation**: 70% improvement over 7 days
- **Cross-team Learning**: Knowledge sharing across projects
- **Skill Level Adaptation**: Helps juniors, empowers seniors

**User Value**: Shows ROI and long-term benefits of adoption.

### 5. **Master Test Runner** (`run-all-tests.js`)
**Purpose**: Interactive, user-friendly test experience with beautiful UI.

**Features**:
- ASCII art welcome screen
- Interactive menu system
- Quick demo option (3 minutes)
- Full suite option (25 minutes)
- Post-test actions (start VERSATIL, view docs)

## Test Design Principles

### 1. **Show, Don't Tell**
Instead of claiming "AI learns", we show:
- First task: 3600 seconds
- Same task later: 300 seconds
- Visual proof of learning

### 2. **Real-World Relevance**
Every test represents actual scenarios:
- Production outages
- Legacy modernization
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance problems

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
Start simple, build complexity:
- Hello World â†’ Microservices
- Single bug â†’ Cascading failures
- One developer â†’ Entire teams

### 4. **Emotional Engagement**
Create "wow" moments:
- 8-minute production fix at 2 AM
- Weekend autonomous improvements
- 260% productivity gain for juniors

### 5. **Interactive Experience**
Not passive watching:
- Menu choices
- Progress indicators
- Clear next steps
- Immediate value
